# uBlock Static Filters for more productivity

Many parts of the internet are engineered to lure you into spending more time on a site than you actually conciously desire. Complex algorithms loads of data and artificial intelligence is used to trick your brain.

Since these sites are engineered to trick your brain there is not a whole lot you can do on your own to combat this. Therefore, it makes a lot of sense to put measures in place which will safe guard you and your brain so you don't fall for the temptation.

These uBlock static filtering rules are what I use to block abusive sites which gives me peace of mind and increases my productivity.
